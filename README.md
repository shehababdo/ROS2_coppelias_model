# ROS2_coppelias_model
The task aims to compare the behavior of a mathematical model and a simulator model using ROS 2 and CoppeliaSim. The mathematical model employed is a kinematic bicycle model, which represents the motion and steering behavior of a vehicle. By implementing both models and analyzing their outputs under different scenarios, the differences in behavior can be identified and evaluated. ROS 2 facilitates communication between the models and other system components, enabling seamless integration and data exchange.
